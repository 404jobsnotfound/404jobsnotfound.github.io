## Overview

The Club Pub is a centralized, interactive platform designed to help students at UH Manoa discover, explore, and engage with a wide variety of student clubs and organizationsâ€”both official and unofficial. With over 200 Registered Independent Organizations and many more student-led groups, the challenge has been to create an easy-to-navigate, comprehensive directory that allows students to learn about clubs, what they do, and how to get involved. The Club Pub aims to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly and dynamic hub for all student organizations at UH Manoa.
