### Overview

The Club Pub is a centralized, interactive platform designed to help students at UH Manoa discover, explore, and engage with a wide variety of student clubs and organizationsâ€”both official and unofficial. With over 200 Registered Independent Organizations and many more student-led groups, the challenge has been to create an easy-to-navigate, comprehensive directory that allows students to learn about clubs, what they do, and how to get involved. The Club Pub aims to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly and dynamic hub for all student organizations at UH Manoa.

## Goals

* To bring students together across campus
* Offer an all-in-one application to browse and join clubs
* Partner with campus clubs to provide an easy application option
* Bring more attention to smaller clubs

## Team Contract
The team has agreed upon these terms. Violation of set terms can and will result in disciplinary action and/or dismissal from the project. The contract has been electronically signed by each team member and is binding.
